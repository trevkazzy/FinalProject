Directions for using my gui code for my final project.
1.	Open MATLAB and access the finalProject.m code
2.	Run finalProject and the interface will appear
3.	Set x and y values with commas in between the numbers (example: x-values: 2,4,6,7,9 y-values: 3,4.5,6.4,7,8)
4.	Set a title and label the axis (Title: Temperature during the month X-axis: day Y-axis: Temperature)
5.	Set the upper and lower limits for both the x and y axis (0<x<10 and 0<y<10)
6.	Customize the plot itself with options of colors and style of point plotted (Green color and dashed line)
7.	Press the plot button which will display the graph and the numbers
8.	If you want to try again with another list of ideas click reset and the plot will be erased back to the starting point
